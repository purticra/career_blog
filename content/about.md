## Hi, I'm Hongyi

I'm an Electrical Engineering student at Georgia Tech with a passion for building things that move, sense, and interact with the world around them. Currently maintaining a 4.00 GPA while diving deep into mechatronics and robotics prototyping.

## What I Do

My work sits at the intersection of electrical systems, mechanical design, and intelligent control. I enjoy taking ideas from concept to physical prototype, whether that's designing microwave filters in a research lab or building bionic robots that swim across water surfaces.

I'm particularly drawn to projects that require creative problem-solving and rapid iteration. From winning hackathons with moon rover designs to developing imitation learning grippers for manufacturing, I thrive in environments where theory meets hands-on engineering.

## My Background

Before Georgia Tech, I spent time working on some fascinating projects in China. At Shanghai Huatai Automation, I designed control systems and mechanical structures for robotic grippers. At Ningbo University's Intelligent Wireless Technology Lab, I worked on high-frequency RF circuits and substrate-integrated waveguide filters.

One of my most ambitious early projects was designing a bionic frog robot that could maneuver on water surfaces using pneumatic actuators. That project taught me the value of biomimetic design and earned me a spot showcasing at ISEF 2024 in Los Angeles.

## Technical Toolkit

I work across multiple domains. On the mechanical side, I'm comfortable with CAD modeling in Fusion 360, 3D printing, laser cutting, and general fabrication. For electronics, I design PCBs, work with embedded systems, and can navigate everything from oscilloscopes to vector network analyzers.

My programming spans C++, Python, and Java, and I've used tools ranging from Ansys HFSS for electromagnetic simulation to Arduino for rapid prototyping.

## Current Focus

Right now, I'm involved with Hytech Racing's Electrical Control Department and staying active in the hackathon scene. Recently, my team won first place at the GT IEEE Robotech Hackathon with our MoonLine rover design, where I served as chief mechanical designer.

I'm also working on µCHIMERA, a stackable nano-power generation device that combines piezoelectric elements with smart design for the Inventure Prize 2026.

## What's Next

I'm seeking internship opportunities in mechatronics and product prototyping for Summer or Fall 2026. I'm especially interested in roles that let me work on physical products from initial concept through manufacturing.

If you're working on something interesting in robotics, automation, or hardware development, I'd love to hear from you.

## Let's Connect

Feel free to reach out at hlyu68@gatech.edu or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/lyu-hongyi). I'm always happy to discuss projects, exchange ideas, or explore collaboration opportunities.
